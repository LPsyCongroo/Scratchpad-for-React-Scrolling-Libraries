# Experimental Sandbox for React Scrolling and Animation Libraries

Basically a messy coding scratchpad for my own purposes. The fruits of this labor will be used on my portfolio site. I'll provide a link when it's up.

To be honest, I've found all of these libraries slightly frustrating in some way. When I have the time, I think I'll make my own library.
